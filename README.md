# mlopsency: you interest to mlops? here's your encyclopedic repo ðŸ‘Š

> Update or CHANGELOG are recorded here: [MLOps Notebooks: Daily Learning](https://pandohansamuel19.notion.site/ea321f9d82154f04919cff9cbd38ddc5?v=15354b42e3144ef5bad1e71336afad46&pvs=4)

All the implementations are running with this current specs and Google Colab Pro.

## Focus of Learn
> Approximately 2 hours/day to learn or update some implementations. On my calender is set from 5.00 - 7.00 (maybe i will provide some sheets later), but if i still as a morning person.

The Hopes that can be implement for this repo:
- What is `'Machine Learning'` or `'Artificial Intelligence'` in general and productions.
- Operations for Implementations
- Imitating [training-data-analyst](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst), but be more encyclopedic ways for MLOps.
- Well, just my preferable ways to learn for the swe + ml/ops + devops in programmic way, So not just only the theoritical thigs.
- can be maintainble as Open Source, specifically for Indonesian Developers
- Critical Thinking > Traditional Thinking
- Frameworks?? we will see ;)

## The Progressive Dirs
1. `binding`: Well, we can learn why distinguished nn framework needs to be implemented for the other OOP paradigms programming languages.
2. `device`: Programmatic ways to served and used the ml/ai resources on types of applications.
3. `docs`: Some interesting parts of resources will be surf on internet.
4. `examples`: Not just learn the basics, but completely true that must used to real use-case examples.
5. `extra`: some research implementations.
6. `paradigm`: The core of ml/ai. if you don't understand paradigms, maybe kind of like 'zombie' or 'stupid'.
7. `test`: we need TDD implementations for some sources so it'll clean and maintainable.

## Contributions
For now, this repo only dedicated for myself. So, hopefully we can work together in more futures.
